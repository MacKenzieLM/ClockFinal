# ClockFinal

This is my attempt at producing an alarm clock using java and java swing.

I had a starting clock and it featured a clock face and 4 buttons.  It was my intention to alter the appearance slightly and to include some features.

Updating clock
Menu bar
Set Alarm window for user to enter their alarms in a sorted queue
An updating digital display of current time
The option to delete or edit alarms
User alarms being saved to text file in order to retrive them again if clock program was closed.
A pop up window displaying the alarm name and time when time reached (no sound)
An about page
Exit button

I could reference code from internet research and have this in my code comments and reference section of report.

The page I could not incorporate was iCalendar and I did have some runtime functionality issues here and there.

I prepared an excel spreadsheet to record alarm testing.
